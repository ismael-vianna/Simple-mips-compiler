# Simple MIPS compiler

Mips compiler developed for Computer Organization class at UERGS (Rio Grande do Sul State University). It returns a memory code to cut and paste on the VHDL memory file. Simply and easy. Built using html and javascript.

It works for a MIPS 32bits.

# Exemple code
The file named codigos-exemplos-compilador-mips2.txt has examples of assembly code and how your code should be on this simple compiler.

*Float number*
The file named codigo-divisao-float.txt has a assembly code exemple that calculate a float number by dividing two integers numbers. This float number is not in the ieee 754 pattern. It just divide number A by number B. This float number is organized as: the 16 bits most significant is the integer part of the number, and the 16 bits less significant is the fraction part. For exemple, the number 11.010101 is
